## Project Overview

- Developing machine learning models to predict air quality using diverse data sources
- Created two supporting R packages to streamline research workflow
- Processing and analyzing massive environmental and traffic datasets

### Components

1. **Air Quality Prediction Model**

   - Data cleansing and preparation
   - Exploratory data analysis
   - Geospatial operations
   - Dataset integration
   - Feature engineering
   - Processing 100M+ rows of environmental data
   - [View Project](https://github.com/heba-razzak/AirQualitySF)

2. **Custom R Packages**
   - [purpleAirAPI](https://github.com/heba-razzak/purpleAirAPI): Streamlined PurpleAir data collection
   - [DataOverviewR](https://github.com/heba-razzak/DataOverviewR): Automated EDA and reporting
