## Context

As a data analyst on the growth team at MNT-Halan, I worked during a pivotal transformation period where the company evolved from a ride-hailing platform into Egypt's largest digital wallet and lending provider, culminating in a $120M Series A raise. The company serves Egypt's underbanked population (70% of 100M+ people) through an integrated ecosystem of ride-hailing, digital payments, and lending services.

## Key Business Outcomes

- 50% Reduction in Ride-Hailing Churn
