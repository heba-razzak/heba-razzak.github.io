## Project Overview
- Developing machine learning models to predict air quality using diverse data sources
- Created two supporting R packages to streamline research workflow
- Processing and analyzing massive environmental and traffic datasets

### Components
1. **Air Quality Prediction Model**
   - Random Forest implementation using PurpleAir, OpenStreetMap, and Uber data
   - Processing 100M+ rows of environmental data
   - [View Project](https://github.com/heba-razzak/AirQualitySF)

2. **Custom R Packages**
   - [purpleAirAPI](https://github.com/heba-razzak/purpleAirAPI): Streamlined PurpleAir data collection
   - [DataOverviewR](https://github.com/heba-razzak/DataOverviewR): Automated EDA and reporting

### Technical Stack
- **Languages**: R
- **Key Libraries**: sf, dplyr, ggplot2, randomForest
- **Data Sources**: PurpleAir sensors, OpenStreetMap, Uber Movement
