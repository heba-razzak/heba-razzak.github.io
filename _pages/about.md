I transform complex business challenges into measurable wins through data-driven solutions. With 5+ years of experience spanning [fintech]({% post_url 2024-11-05-mnt-halan %}), e-commerce, and [cloud kitchens]({% post_url 2024-12-01-the-food-lab %}), I've helped scale startups to multi-million dollar valuations and cut customer churn in half. My superpower? Making complex data insights actionable for everyone - from CEOs making strategic decisions to operations teams improving daily workflows.

## What Makes Me Different:

- I create data cultures from scratch. At a cloud kitchen startup, I turned raw data into a decision-making engine that directly contributed to securing a **[$4.5M pre-seed raise](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/18/the-food-lab-an-egyptian-cloud-kitchen-provider-raises-4-5m-pre-seed-for-expansion/)**.
- I thrive on solving ‘impossible’ problems—cutting ride-hailing churn by 50%, processing 100M+ environmental data points, and finding creative solutions in high-stakes environments.
- I speak every team’s language. By combining curiosity with clear communication, I build solutions that resonate across diverse perspectives and deliver measurable impact.

## Latest Milestones

- M.S. Data Science, University of Arizona (4.0 GPA) - May 2024
- Published [R package]({% post_url 2024-11-12-purple-air-api %}) on CRAN, making environmental data analysis more accessible
- Independent project on food pantry accessibility [analysis]({% post_url 2024-11-13-second-harvest %}) optimizing resource allocation in Orange County
- Tutored an actuarial scientist transitioning from Excel to Python, equipping their team with enhanced technical skills and more efficient workflows
